# Tolkien Fan Club

**I like Tolkien**. Read my [first post here](/majesty) (sorry the link doesn't work yet)

## Reasons I like him

1. You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
2. The languages are amazing
3. The poems are fun
4. I like hobbits
5. It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike

## My favorite characters (in order)

* Gandalf
* Bilbo
* Sam
* Glorfindel
* Galadriel
* Elrond
* Thorin Oakenshield

Here is some `code` example.

I hope the movies _didn't ruin it_ for you.
